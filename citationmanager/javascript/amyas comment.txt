I'd like to see this sorted out into "research" and "design" sections. 

You've done a lot of investigating so you should have some interesting things to write up in terms of research, including existing reference managers and how to approach widget construction as a first-timer - it would be valuable to share the pointers you've received from Simon, Oszcar and Wu Di so they can help future newcomers.

In terms of design you should be focussing on satisfying a few core use cases - you decide which - using the model you have decided on.  From our discussions I understand that model is all-native, with no real-time integration with external reference managers, just file import/export.  That's fine and makes sense to me, but it is a bit counter to the general trend of Sakai3, so I think it is really important that you also spend some time writing up why you wanted to integrate with reference managers and why you eventually decided not to. 

Just as a technical note I think the logical choice of file format for import and export is RIS as used by Zotero and Mendeley, amongst others.  It's very straightforward.
